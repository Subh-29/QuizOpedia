## üí° What is Quizopedia?

**Quizopedia** is a full-stack quiz management system where:

* **Admins** can create quizzes (manually or with AI help).
* **Users** can attempt them once and see their scores.
* AI can **explain wrong answers** when asked.
* Everything is protected by **role-based auth** (JWT), with separate routes and access levels.

The stack?

* **Frontend**: Next.js + Redux Toolkit + TailwindCSS + GSAP
* **Backend**: Express.js + Prisma (PostgreSQL) + JWT
* **AI**: Gemini API (Google Generative AI)
